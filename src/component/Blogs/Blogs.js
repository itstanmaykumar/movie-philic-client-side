                    <ul>
                        <li>SQL is used for relational databases, but NoSQL is used for non-relational database.</li>
                        <li>SQL uses fixed or static or predefined schema, but NoSQL uses dynamic schema.</li>
                        <li>SQL cannot be used for hierarchical data storage, but NoSQL is best for hierarchical data storage.</li>
                        <li>SQL is best suited for complex queries and NoSQL is not so good best suited for complex queries.</li>
                        <li>SQL databases are vertically scalable, but NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.</li>
                        <li>SQL databases are are table based, but NoSQL databases are are document, key-value, graph or wide-column stores.</li>

                    <h5>Purpose -</h5>
                    <p>JWT means JSON Web Token. It is an open standard used to share security information between two parties (a client and a server). It is a very popular standard which is used to trust and verify requests by using digital signatures, and to exchange information between parties.</p>
                    <h5>Working Procedure -</h5>
                    <p>A JWT is a string made up of three parts (header, payload, signature), separated by dots (.). Therefore, a JWT typically looks like the following. <br /><b>xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>header</b> contains contains the type of secret token and the signing algorithm.</li>
                        <li><b>payload</b> contains contains the claims.</li>
                        <li><b>signature</b> ensures that the token hasnâ€™t been altered.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>When a user logs in or registers, the authentication server verifies the credentials and issues a jwt signed using a secret key. Then the resource server verifies the authenticity of the token using the secret key. It uses the signature to verify the information wasn't changed along the way.</p>
